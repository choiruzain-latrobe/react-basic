# React Basics

This repository provides a beginner-friendly introduction to React, covering essential concepts and setup instructions. Let's dive in!

## React Overview

- **React**:
    - React is a **JavaScript library** used for building user interfaces (UIs) in web applications.
    - Developed by Facebook, it has gained widespread adoption in the industry.
    - React enables developers to create **reusable UI components** and manage state efficiently.

- **JSX (JavaScript XML)**:
    - React uses a **syntax extension** called JSX.
    - JSX allows developers to write HTML-like code directly within JavaScript, simplifying UI component creation.
    - For instance, instead of using `React.createElement()`, JSX lets you write components like `<MyComponent />`.

- **Functions as Building Blocks**:
    - In React, a **function** serves as a fundamental building block.
    - Think of these functions as **Lego bricks** that you can assemble to create complex UI structures.
    - Each function (component) can be reused across different parts of your application.

- **Virtual DOM**:
    - React employs a **virtual DOM (Document Object Model)**.
    - The virtual DOM is a lightweight representation of the actual DOM.
    - When changes occur in your React application, React computes the difference between the virtual DOM and the real DOM.
    - Only the specific changes are then applied to the real DOM, enhancing performance and minimizing unnecessary updates.

## Prerequisites

Before diving into React, ensure you have the following knowledge:

1. **JavaScript**:
    - React is a JavaScript framework, so familiarity with JavaScript is essential.
    - Understand concepts like arrays, classes, objects, and arrow functions.

2. **HTML**:
    - Since React involves creating UI components, a basic understanding of HTML is necessary.
    - Refer to this HTML cheatsheet if needed.

## Getting Started

1. **Download Node.js**:
    - If you haven't already, [download](https://nodejs.org/en/download) and install Node.js.

2. **Code Editor (VS Code)**:
    - Open your preferred code editor. [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download) (VS Code) is recommended.

3. **Create a New Project**:
    - Create a new directory for your React project (e.g., `my-react-app`, or `react-basic`).

4. **Clone this Repository**:
    - Clone this repository into your project folder:
      ```
      git clone <repository_url>
      ```

5. **Install Dependencies**:
    - In the terminal, navigate to your project folder:
      ```
      cd react-basic or 
      cd my-react-app
      ```
    - Run the following command to install dependencies:
      ```
      npm install
      ```

6. **Start the Development Server**:
    - Run the following command to start the development server:
      ```
      npm run dev
      ```
    - Your application will be accessible in the browser at http://localhost:5137/.


## Project Structure

- **node_modules**: External libraries your project relies on.
- **public**: Contains public assets.
- **src**: The most important folder where you'll spend most of your time.
- **assets**: Not critical; holds additional assets.
- **main.jsx**: The main entry point for your React application (main JavaScript file).
- **App.jsx**: The first port of component in this example.
- **Comp**: Placeholder for your components.
